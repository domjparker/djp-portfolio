                      I am a Full stack web developer with a background in education and a history of creating meaningful learning experiences for students from a variety of age-groups and backgrounds. I have strong interpersonal skills, with an emphasis on communication, conflict resolution, project management, and classroom instruction. My career to date has had a focus on humanitarian work and people development. Because of this, I strongly value transformational leadership, humility in learning, and collaboration. I aim to leverage my prior teaching insights with skills gained from recently completing a certificate in full stack web development from the University of Washington. Just as in my previous experience working with students of all ages, I am excited to use my expanding skills in web development to create user-oriented applications. I am knowledgeable in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, React.js, Node.js, MySQL, and MongoDB.

                      Originally from New Zealand, I love getting outdoors,
                      spending time connecting with others, inventing, and improving
                      things.
